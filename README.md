# RemoteFarming

RemoteFarming is a fully funtional prototype for a remote and web-based crop irrigation control and monitoring system.

The stack of this system consists of the following:
-Particle (Spark) IOT physical computing platform
-Automated cloud-based logging of system data
-Javascript web interface for controlling Particle irrigation system, monitoring system state, and displaying cloud-based logged data

Web interface intuitively displays the current and past states of the remote irrigation system. Connection status, system online status, battery level, etc are displayed using basic color coding: green = connected / online, red = disconnected / offline, gray = loading...
